[NumPy's](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.scalars.html) with a few extensions (`categorical`, `datetime64` with timezone, `timedelta64`).\n","An advantage of the DataFrame over a 2-dimensional NumPy array is that the DataFrame can have columns of various types within a single table.\n","That said, each column should have a specific dtype; you don't want to be mixing bools with ints with strings within a single column.\n","For one thing, this is slow.\n","It forces the column to be have an `object` dtype (the fallback python-object container type), which means you don't get any of the type-specific optimizations in pandas or NumPy.\n","For another, it means you're probably violating the maxims of tidy data, which we'll discuss next time.\n","\n","When should you have `object` columns?\n","There are a few places where the NumPy / pandas type system isn't as rich as you might like.\n","There's no integer NA (at the moment anyway), so if you have any missing values, represented by `NaN`, your otherwise integer column will be floats.\n","There's also no `date` dtype (distinct from `datetime`).\n","Consider the needs of your application: can you treat an integer `1` as `1.0`?\n","Can you treat `date(2016, 1, 1)` as `datetime(2016, 1, 1, 0, 0)`?\n","In my experience, this is rarely a problem other than when writing to something with a stricter schema like a database.\n","But at that point it's fine to cast to one of the less performant types, since you're just not doing numeric operations anymore.\n","\n","The last case of `object` dtype data is text data.\n","Pandas doesn't have any fixed-width string dtypes, so you're stuck with python objects.\n","There is an important exception here, and that's low-cardinality text data, for which you'll want to use the `category` dtype (see below).\n","\n","If you have object data (either strings or python objects) that needs to be converted, checkout the [`to_numeric`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.0/generated/pandas.to_numeric.html), [`to_datetime`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.0/generated/pandas.to_datetime.html) and

meaningful).\n","There are various steps that can be taken to improve your code's performance from relatively simple changes, to rewriting your code in a lower-level language, to trying to parallelize it.\n","And while you might have many options, there's typically an order you would proceed in.\n","\n","First (and I know it's cliché to say so, but still) benchmark your code.\n","Make sure you actually need to spend time optimizing it.\n","There are [many](https://github.com/nvdv/vprof) [options](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) [for](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler) [benchmarking](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/timeit.html) and visualizing where things are slow.\n","\n","Second, consider your algorithm.\n","Make sure you aren't doing more work than you need to.\n","A common one I see is doing a full sort on an array, just to select the `N` largest or smallest items.\n","Pandas has methods for
